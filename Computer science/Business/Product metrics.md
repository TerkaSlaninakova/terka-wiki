# Product Analysis and Business Metrics Interview Questions

## Example problems

1. In 2011 Facebook launched messenger as a standalone app for mobile devices (it used to only be part of the Facebook App). How would you **track the performance of this new application**? **What metrics** would you use?
- generic:
    - **Daily active users, Montly active users**, measure before and after
    - **Total time spent**
- messenger-specific:
    - \# of messages sent
    - response time

Think about explanations to the metrics: is it possible more time is being spent on the app because it is harder to use?
