# Linear regression
Linear regression is about fitting a line / hyperplane to a set of points. Given a set of points `(x_1,x_2), ..., (x_n,y_n)`, find a hyperplane `y = w_i x_i + b`. To know that out hyperplane is good, we have a **loss**, e.g. (mean)squared error (also L2 loss) that's (observation - prediction)^2
