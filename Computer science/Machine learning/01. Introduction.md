# What is ML about
Machine Learning is getting computers to program themselves. If programming is automation, then machine learning is automating the process of automation. It's [software 2.0](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35).

More specifically, ML is about making observations about uncertain world, using statistics, not logic to analyze results of the experiments. A lot of it boils down to a simple function approximation and in general approximating underlying mapping function from inputs to outputs - there's input data, output data and some unknown underlying correlation that we want to capture.

## It's crutially important to:
- Understand the problem domain (have some prior knowledge), have clearly defined goals
- Get one with the dataset representing the problem - know how to collect it, clean it
- Know what algorithms/approaches to use
- Know how to evaluate performance of the model and interpret its results
