# Human biases in Datasets
## Reporting bias
Occurs when frequency of events doesn't reflect the real-worls frequency (e.g. overrepresenting negative reviews, because ppl w/ negative experience are more likely to leave a review)

## Automation bias
Overreliance on automated solutions when manual ones give better results

## Selection bias
Examples are not chosen to represent real-world distribution
    - coverage/non-response/sampling bias

## Group attribution bias
Overgeneralization of what is true to some individuals of the group to the entire group 

## Implicit bias
Subjective (incorrect) assumptions are brought into the dataset
