## Case studies

### Changing the text on a website improve donations?
- an example of A/B testing
#### Experiment design:
1. randombly show visitors one version / other
2. measure how much they donate
3. determine which is better

Key idea here: **Statistical inference**
**Population** is all possible donors. It's impractical if not impossible to know decisions of all the population, so we **sample** it. Then we calculate the **descriptive statistics (decisions of the sample)**. Then inferential statistic is used to figure out of the data gathered from the sample would play out in the same way in the whole population.

## Other important concepts
- confounding variables:
    - shoe size and literacy have strong correlation, but they have a confounding variable causing this correlation: age
    - "correlation is not causation" / "spurious correlation"
    - p-hacking ([green jelly beans cause acne](https://xkcd.com/882/))
