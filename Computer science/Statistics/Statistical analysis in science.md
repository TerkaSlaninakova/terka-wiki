# p-values
A measure of how likely it is that the results of the study would've come out the way they did if the **null hypothesis** were true (i.e. if there's no effect and the results are random, what's the probability that they'd be what they are).

What p-values don't tell us is how likely is the hypothesis to be true. It's really just a quick smell test.

The results are said to be **statistically significant** if the p-value is > 0.05 (which is really a rather artificial cut-off). There's an incentive to [get rid of this notion in science publishing](https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/get-rid-of-statistical-significance/), because it doesn't take into context other statistical measures, encourages false dichotomy of this is a real effect / this is nothing, throw it out and encourages **p-hacking**.
