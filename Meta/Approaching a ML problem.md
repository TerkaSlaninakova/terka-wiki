# Approaching a ML problem
It's important to approach any ML problem systematically, focusing on the questions we want to answer.

## Example scenario
Goal: Fraud detection
Step 0: Questions to answer:
- how to measure if my fraud detection prediction is working?
- what will be the business impact of my solution?
    - if i save my company 100$ a month, maybe it's not worth developing

Step 1: Acquiring the data, building a prototype

Step 2: Production
Quite a complicated topic and very different from ML in Prototyping
